         * What is it?
         *
         * The Prototype pattern allows for creating new objects by cloning existing ones.
         * This is especially useful when object creation is expensive and you want to avoid
         * redundant instantiation.
         *
         * When to Use?
         *
         * Itâ€™s ideal when cloning an object is more efficient than creating a new one from scratch,
         * or when an object has complex initialization that can be replicated.
         *
         * How it Works?
         *
         * A class implements the Cloneable interface and provides a method to clone itself.
         * This allows new instances to be created by copying an existing object, rather than
         * instantiating a new one.
